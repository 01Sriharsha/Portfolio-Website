                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p id="p1"> Visvesvaraya was born in a Telugu Brahmin family,[7] to Mokshagundam Srinivasa Shastry and
                    Venkatalakshmamma of Muddenahalli, whose ancestors hail from the Mokshagundam village in present-day
                    Andhra Pradesh and had migrated here around three hundred years prior to Visvesvaraya's
                    birth.[8][9][10] Visvesvaraya was born in Muddenahalli of Mysore Kingdom (present-day Chikkaballapur
                    district of Karnataka). He studied at the College of Engineering Pune (then the College of Science)
                    and graduated as an engineer.[11] It was here that he became a member of the Deccan Club and was its
                    first secretary; he would therefore have been well-acquainted with the progressives in Pune,
                    including Sir R. G.</p>
